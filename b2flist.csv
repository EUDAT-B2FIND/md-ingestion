Furthermore, BBMRI provided European researchers with effective access to resources and facilities, along with common services that include a joint IT service and scientific, technical, ethical, and legal expertise. Through a European framework, researchers could gain support at all stages of the biomedical R&D process. The preparatory phase of BBMRI came to an end in January 2011. And in its last year, BBMRI grew into a 54-member consortium with more than 225 associated organisations from over 30 countries, making it one of the largest research infrastructure projects in Europe.

This research community focuses on social in/exclusion, vulnerability-at-work and related social and labour market policies from a European comparative perspective. Key tools in this social science research are all types of data: statistics on earnings, administrative social data, labour market data, surveys of quality of life or working conditions, and policy indicators. For the period 2017-2021, the infrastructure has received funding for another 4 year project by the European H2020-programme: the InGRID-2 project. As a continuation of the launch of the infrastructure in 2013, this project will work on the infrastructure as an advanced research infrastructure. The full project title is ""InGRID-2 Integrating Research Infrastructure for European expertise on Inclusive Growth from data to policy"".
