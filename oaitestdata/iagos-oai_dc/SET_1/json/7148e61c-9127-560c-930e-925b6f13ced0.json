In order to reduce uncertainties associated with data gaps, we discarded (i) all profiles with more than 25% of missing temperature data between 0 and 4 km (i.e. cumulated data gaps larger than 0.25x4000=2000 m), and/or (ii) all profiles with more than 4 missing data between the surface and the estimated PBL height (i.e. cumulated data gaps larger than 4x50=200 m). \n3) The profiles are expressed in the z/h vertical coordinate system where z is the altitude and h the PBL height estimate.
