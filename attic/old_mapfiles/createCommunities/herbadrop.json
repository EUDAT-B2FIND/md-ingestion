  "description" : "[Herbadrop]( https://www.eudat.eu/herbadrop-an-innovative-approach-to-long-term-preservation-and-analysis-of-digitised-herbarium \"Herbadrop\") is both an archival service for long-term preservation of herbarium specimen images and a tool for extracting information by image analysis. Developed by five institutes from Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands and Scotland it aims to be available to other herbaria in the future. Making the specimen images and data available online from different institutes allows cross-domain research and data analysis for botanists and researchers with diverse interests (e.g. ecology, social and cultural history, climate change).",
