  "description" : "[ALEPH]( https://home.cern/about/experiments/aleph \"ALEPH\")  was a particle physics experiment installed on the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva/Switzerland. It was designed to explore the physics predicted by the Standard Model and to search for physics beyond it. ALEPH first measured events in LEP in July 1989. LEP operated at around 91 GeV â€“ the predicted optimum energy for the formation of the Z particle. From 1995 to 2000 the accelerator operated at energies up to 200 GeV, above the threshold for producing pairs of W particles.\nThe data taken, consisted of millions of events recorded by the ALEPH detector,allowed precision tests of the electro-weak Standard Model (SM) to be undertaken. The group here concentrated our analysis efforts mainly in Heavy Flavour (beauty and charm) physics, in searches for the the Higgs boson, the particles postulated to generate particle mass, and for physics beyond the SM, e.g. Supersymmetry, and in W physics.",
