  "description" : "[EnviDat]( https://www.envidat.ch \"EnviDat\") is the environmental data portal developed at the WSL Eidg. Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Wald, Schnee und Landschaft. The project aims at developing an efficient, unified and managed access portal for WSL's rich reservoir of environmental monitoring and research data, according to the data policy of WSL. EnviDat is designed as a portal to publish, connect and search across existing data, rather than as a large data centre. The responsibility to curate research data remains with the original data providers.",
