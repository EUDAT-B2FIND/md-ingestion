     "description" : "[EISCAT](https://www.eiscat.se/ \"EISCAT\") is an international scientific association with member institutes in several countries. We conduct ionospheric and atmospheric measurements with radars. As an example we can observe effects of the aurora borealis or the northern lights. We operate in three countries: Finland, Norway and Sweden, and all our facilities are located north of the Arctic circle. We are associated with our radar antennas, that are located in Kiruna, Sweden; Sodankyä, Finland; Tromsø, Norway and in Longyearbyen, Svalbard. In Tromsø we also have a combined ionospheric heating and short-wave radar facility. EISCAT3D will be an international research infrastructure. Using radar observations and the incoherent scatter technique the goal is to develop the ways to study the atmosphere and near-Earth space environment above the Fenno-Scandinavian Arctic. The radar system is designed to investigate how the Earth's atmosphere is coupled to space but it will also be suitable for a wide range of other scientific targets.",
