  "description" : "The information system [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/about/ \"PANGAEA\") is operated as an Open Access library aimed at archiving, publishing and distributing georeferenced data from earth system research. The system guarantees long-term availability of its content through a commitment of the hosting institutions. Most of the data are freely available and can be used under the terms of the license mentioned on the data set description. A few password protected data sets are under moratorium from ongoing projects. The description of each data set is always visible and includes the principle investigator (PI) who may be asked for access. Each dataset can be identified, shared, published and cited by using a Digital Object Identifier (DOI Name). PANGAEA also allows data to be published as supplements to science articles (example) or as citable data collections in combination with data journals like ESSD, Geoscience Data Journal, Scientific Data, or others. The PANGAEA data editorial ensures the integrity and authenticity as well as a high usability of your data. Archived data are machine readable and mirrored into our data warehouse which allows efficient compilations of data. PANGAEA is open to any project, institution, or individual scientist to use or to archive and publish data.",
