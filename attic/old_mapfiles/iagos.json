     "description" : "In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System [IAGOS](https://www.iagos.org/ \"IAGOS\")) is a European Research Infrastructure for global observations of atmospheric composition from commercial aircraft. IAGOS combines the expertise of scientific institutions with the infrastructure of civil aviation in order to provide essential data on climate change and air quality at a global scale. In order to provide optimal information, two complementary systems have been implemented, (i) IAGOS-CORE providing global coverage on a day-to-day basis of key observables and (ii) IAGOS-CARIBIC providing a more in-depth and complex set of observations with lesser geographical and temporal coverage.",
