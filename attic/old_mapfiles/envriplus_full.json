Our Operators include renowned marine biological stations and institutes across European and Associated countries. By providing access to state-of-the-art national facilities, EMBRC-ERIC will provide the necessary and relevant services, facilities and technology platforms to study marine organisms and ecosystems. EMBRC-ERIC will help promote the development of blue biotechnologies by supporting fundamental and applied research activities in medicine, nutrition, aquaculture, biotechnology, and fisheries, among others. The vision is for EMBRC-ERIC to be a global reference Research Infrastructure for fundamental and applied marine biology and ecology research.",
