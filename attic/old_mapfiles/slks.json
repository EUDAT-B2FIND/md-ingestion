The agency provides advice to the Danish minister of culture and is involved in setting and achieving the governments cultural policy goals. Another task involves allocating funds for both individuals and organisations and institutions as well as collecting, processing and disseminating information and findings to promote cultural development. The agency is responsible for managing and maintaining state-owned palaces and castles, gardens and cultural properties. We rely on professional and innovative approaches to optimise the use of resources in achieving the goals under the governments cultural policy.",
