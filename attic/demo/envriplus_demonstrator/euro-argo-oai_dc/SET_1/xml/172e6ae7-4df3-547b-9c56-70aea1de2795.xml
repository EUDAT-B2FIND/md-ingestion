      <dct:abstract>GOSUD aims at assembling in-situ observations of the world ocean surface collected by a variety of ships and at distributing quality controlled datasets.  At present time the variables considered by GOSUD are temperature and salinity.
The GOSUD data are mostly collected using thermosalinographs (TSG) installed on research vessels, on commercial ships and in some cases on sailing exploration ships. GOSUD manages both near-real time (RT and NRT) data and delayed mode (DM-reprocessed) data.
The GOSUD GDAC is hosted by the Coriolis data centre (France) and a back-up (permanent archived) is performed on a daily basis by NCEIS (NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information).</dct:abstract>

      <dc:source>The GOSUD data are T &amp; S surface data acquired using thermosalinograph instruments on board R/V and Ships of opportunity.
The data are transmitted in Near real time whenever it is possible.
The data are then quality controlled and ajusted using water sample analysis.</dc:source>
