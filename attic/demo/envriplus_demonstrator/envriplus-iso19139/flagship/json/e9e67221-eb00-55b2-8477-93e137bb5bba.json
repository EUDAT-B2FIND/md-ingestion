        "The data product vegetation encompasses biodiversity data from a range of LTER sites in Europe. The result from vegetation survey data covering frequency plots following the UNECE IM protocol. For frequency plots 5 × 5 m areas were used with replicates at each LTER sites. Within each of these areas, vegetation was recorded on two permanently marked 0.5 × 0.5 m subplots. For each subplot, the percentage ground cover of every vascular plant was determined. Harmonisation of species names was done with the R-package TLP was used"
