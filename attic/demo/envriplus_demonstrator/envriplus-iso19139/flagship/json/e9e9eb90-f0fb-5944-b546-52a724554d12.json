        "The data product meteorology encompasses data from meteorological stations implemented at the LTER sites in Europe. Data with daily resolution are provided from most of the stations. As minimum variable set air temperature (2m height) and precipitation (at 1m height) needs to be provided. In addition auxilliary data (e.g. near-surface air temperature, air pressure (at 2m height), relative humidity (at 2m height), wind speed and wind direction, net radiation) can be provided. Data are provided using a simple data reporting format according to the eLTER VA specification"
