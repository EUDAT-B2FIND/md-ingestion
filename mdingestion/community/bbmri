    DESCRIPTION = """The main vision of the project was to increase the scientific excellence and efficacy of European research in the biomedical sciences with the aim of expanding and securing competitiveness in a global context as well as attracting investments in pharmaceutical and biomedical research facilities. BBMRI reached the goals forecasted by creating a pan-European research infrastructure and by developing biobanks and biomolecular resources. Furthermore, BBMRI provided European researchers with effective access to resources and facilities, along with common services that include a joint IT service and scientific, technical, ethical, and legal expertise. Through a European framework, researchers could gain support at all stages of the biomedical R&D process. The preparatory phase of BBMRI came to an end in January 2011. And in its last year, BBMRI grew into a 54-member consortium with more than 225 associated organisations from over 30 countries, making it one of the largest research infrastructure projects in Europe. It transformed again to become a more permanent initiative, now BBMRI-ERIC."""
